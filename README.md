# Sprint 0 - Paper tower

# Bennet Schachler 1/25/2024
For our first sprint we will be practicing the process of design, and submission of sprints using Github.

You will document and submit your design process in this GitHub repository. Your design process will involve all of the stages that you will show in each stage of our RoboCup project, but for this first sprint we will be working without technology.

## Goal

For your roboCup sprints you will be setting your own goals that can be completed within a given time (usually two weeks). For our first sprint your goal will be given to you and will be completed in one week.

`Create a design for the tallest possible tower using a single sheet of plain printer paper`

### Restrictions

- No tape, glue, water or other adhesive
- No supports
- Must stand for 30 seconds
- Cutting is allowed
- Normal earth gravity
- Standard paper weight
- sheet size 8.5x11 inches (letter)

You will submit the instructions and diagrams that would allow another to make your designed tower, 

## Process

You will follow the steps outlined below (for both this sprint and those for our RoboCup design).

### Research
[I looked online for tips on how to build a paper tower out of one sheet of paper with nothing but the paper.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tuEBEKOProY)

I asked Enze (Andy) Wang

You will research and document technical resources that you believe will help you succeed at the sprint.

### Ideation
I did not create any sketches. I just built the tower

You will create quick sketches or descriptions of your planned design

### Prototyping

I started off by trying different sizes of paper for the base, checking the size of the paper strips I used to tie the cut big pieces together to stabilize them. 

We tried different stages, different ways of tieing the pieces together. tried rolling the ends in, to put more friction. We tried cutting edges into the papers, so they couldnt slide down into each other.

### Testing and Critique

I tried building a similar tower to Andy, as he already had one standing, I took inspiration from his knots, the piece sizes he cut for each

You will evaluate your prototype and document your thinking, what you have learned and how you will improve your design.

### Final design
For my final design we used the piece of paper and cut it in half as often as we could. when he had like 2cm of paper left, we cut short and slim strips that we used to tie the bigger pieces together. 



You will document your final design idea in detail, with enough technical detail for another engineer to recreate your work

### Conclusion

Concluding I had a 67cm high tower, that I didnt photograph and disassembled after the last class. 

You will make a brief comment on the success of your design and what next steps others might build on your work.
